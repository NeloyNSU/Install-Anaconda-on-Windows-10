and machine learning related applications (large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, scientific computing), that aims to simplify 
package management and deployment. Package versions are managed by the package management system conda.The Anaconda distribution is used 
by over 6 million users, and it includes more than 250 popular data science packages suitable for Windows, Linux, and MacOS.

## Prerequisites for Anaconda
